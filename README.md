## Intro

Learning from demonstration is an efficient method of acquiring new motion skills in robotics, which usually requires the demonstration character and the target character to have similar morphology. For example, human and humanoid, dog and quadrupedal robot. Yet in the real world, most robots are not human-like nor animal-like. This fact makes it difficult or sometimes unattainable to find their corresponding demonstrations. In order to resolve this issue and obtain future experiments. In this project, we addressed the issue of learning motions from demonstration provided by a character with different morphologies and studied the properties. In simpler words, we answered the question “can we transfer motions across different morphologies?” To narrow down the problem size, we focused on studying the motions of a mobile manipulation system from human demonstrations.
